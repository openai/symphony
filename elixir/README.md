# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the current Elixir/OTP implementation of Symphony, based on
[`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) at the repository root.

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony Elixir is prototype software intended for evaluation only and is presented as-is.
> We recommend implementing your own hardened version based on `SPEC.md`.

## How it works

1. Polls the configured tracker for candidate work (included production adapters are Linear and GitLab)
2. Creates a workspace per issue
3. Launches Codex in [App Server mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/) inside the
   workspace
4. Sends a workflow prompt to Codex
5. Keeps Codex working on the issue until the work is done

During app-server sessions, the selected tracker adapter may advertise provider-native tools. The
Linear adapter serves `linear_graphql`; the GitLab adapter serves `gitlab_api`. Symphony executes
those tools with configured auth and removes each adapter's declared token environment variables
from the Codex child, so the agent does not need a second tracker login.

If a claimed issue moves to a terminal state (`Done`, `Closed`, `Cancelled`, or `Duplicate`),
Symphony stops the active agent for that issue and cleans up matching workspaces.

If Codex reports that operator input, approval, or MCP elicitation is required, Symphony keeps the
issue claimed and exposes it as blocked in the runtime state, JSON API, and dashboard. Blocked
entries are in memory only; restarting the orchestrator clears that blocked map, so any still-active
tracker issue can become a dispatch candidate again after restart.

## How to use it

1. Make sure your codebase is set up to work well with agents: see
   [Harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/).
2. Get a new personal token in Linear via Settings → Security & access → Personal API keys, and
   set it as the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Copy this directory's `WORKFLOW.md` to your repo.
4. Optionally copy the `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `land`, and `linear` skills to your repo.
   - The `linear` skill expects Symphony's `linear_graphql` app-server tool for raw Linear GraphQL
     operations such as comment editing or upload flows.
5. Customize the copied `WORKFLOW.md` file for your project.
   - To get your project's slug, right-click the project and copy its URL. The slug is part of the
     URL.
   - When creating a workflow based on this repo, note that it depends on non-standard Linear
     issue statuses: "Rework", "Human Review", and "Merging". You can customize them in
     Team Settings → Workflow in Linear.
6. Follow the instructions below to install the required runtime dependencies and start the service.

## Prerequisites

We recommend using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Elixir/Erlang versions.

```bash
mise install
mise exec -- elixir --version
```

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/symphony
cd symphony/elixir
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- mix setup
mise exec -- mix build
mise exec -- ./bin/symphony ./WORKFLOW.md
```

## Burrito releases

Symphony ships self-contained executables built with
[Burrito](https://github.com/burrito-elixir/burrito). They embed Erlang/OTP, Elixir, and Symphony,
but still expect `codex`, `git`, and the selected tracker credentials on the target machine.

Supported release targets:

- `macos_arm64`
- `macos_x86_64`
- `linux_arm64`
- `linux_x86_64`

`v*` tags publish all four targets with checksums. A manual workflow run builds the same
artifacts without creating a release.

After downloading the executable for your platform from a release:

```bash
chmod +x ./symphony-v0.0.1-macos_arm64
./symphony-v0.0.1-macos_arm64 ./WORKFLOW.md
```

## Configuration

Pass a custom workflow file path to `./bin/symphony` when starting the service:

```bash
./bin/symphony /path/to/custom/WORKFLOW.md
```

If no path is passed, Symphony defaults to `./WORKFLOW.md`.

Optional flags:

- `--logs-root` tells Symphony to write logs under a different directory (default: `./log`)
- `--port` also starts the Phoenix observability service (default: disabled)

The `WORKFLOW.md` file uses YAML front matter for configuration, plus a Markdown body used as the
Codex session prompt.

Minimal example:

```md
---
tracker:
  kind: linear
  provider:
    project_slug: "..."
workspace:
  root: ~/code/workspaces
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git .
agent:
  max_concurrent_agents: 10
  max_turns: 20
codex:
  command: codex app-server
---

You are working on an issue from the configured tracker {{ issue.identifier }}.

Title: {{ issue.title }} Body: {{ issue.description }}
```

Notes:

- If a value is missing, defaults are used.
- `tracker.kind` selects an adapter. Adapter-owned endpoint, scope, and auth settings belong under
  `tracker.provider`; the current Linear adapter still accepts the older flat `endpoint`,
  `api_key`, `project_slug`, and `assignee` aliases for compatibility.
- `tracker.required_labels` is optional. When set, an issue must have every
  configured label to dispatch or continue running. Label matching ignores
  case and surrounding whitespace. A blank configured label matches no issue.
- Safer Codex defaults are used when policy fields are omitted:
  - `codex.approval_policy` defaults to `{"reject":{"sandbox_approval":true,"rules":true,"mcp_elicitations":true}}`
  - `codex.thread_sandbox` defaults to `workspace-write`
  - `codex.turn_sandbox_policy` defaults to a `workspaceWrite` policy rooted at the current issue workspace
- Supported `codex.approval_policy` values depend on the targeted Codex app-server version. In the current local Codex schema, string values include `untrusted`, `on-failure`, `on-request`, and `never`, and object-form `reject` is also supported.
- Supported `codex.thread_sandbox` values: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`.
- When `codex.turn_sandbox_policy` is set explicitly, Symphony passes the map through to Codex
  unchanged. Compatibility then depends on the targeted Codex app-server version rather than local
  Symphony validation.
- Workflows that run package managers or other commands that resolve external hosts should set
  `networkAccess: true` in `codex.turn_sandbox_policy`; otherwise DNS/network access may be denied
  by the Codex turn sandbox.
- `agent.max_turns` caps how many back-to-back Codex turns Symphony will run in a single agent
  invocation when a turn completes normally but the issue is still in an active state. Default: `20`.
- If the Markdown body is blank, Symphony uses a default prompt template that includes the issue
  identifier, title, and body.
- Use `hooks.after_create` to bootstrap a fresh workspace. For a Git-backed repo, you can run
  `git clone ... .` there, along with any other setup commands you need.
- If a hook needs `mise exec` inside a freshly cloned workspace, trust the repo config and fetch
  the project dependencies in `hooks.after_create` before invoking `mise` later from other hooks.
- For the Linear adapter, `tracker.provider.api_key` reads from `LINEAR_API_KEY` when unset or
  when value is `$LINEAR_API_KEY`. The legacy flat `tracker.api_key` alias behaves the same way.
- For the GitLab adapter, `tracker.provider.api_key` reads from `GITLAB_PAT` when unset; `$VAR`
  references are also supported.
- Do not put a literal tracker token in a repo-owned `WORKFLOW.md` if Codex can read that
  workspace. Use `$VAR`/host-side secret references so Symphony can keep the token out of the
  child environment.
- For path values, `~` is expanded to the home directory.
- For env-backed path values, use `$VAR`. `workspace.root` resolves `$VAR` before path handling,
  while `codex.command` stays a shell command string and any `$VAR` expansion there happens in the
  launched shell.

```yaml
tracker:
  provider:
    api_key: $LINEAR_API_KEY
workspace:
  root: $SYMPHONY_WORKSPACE_ROOT
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone --depth 1 "$SOURCE_REPO_URL" .
codex:
  command: "$CODEX_BIN --config 'model=\"gpt-5.5\"' app-server"
```

- If `WORKFLOW.md` is missing or has invalid YAML at startup, Symphony does not boot.
- If a later reload fails, Symphony keeps running with the last known good workflow and logs the
  reload error until the file is fixed.
- `server.port` or CLI `--port` enables the optional Phoenix LiveView dashboard and JSON API at
  `/`, `/api/v1/state`, `/api/v1/<issue_identifier>`, and `/api/v1/refresh`.

### Linear adapter profile

- Config: use `tracker.kind: linear` with `tracker.provider.endpoint` (default
  `https://api.linear.app/graphql`), `api_key` (defaults to `LINEAR_API_KEY` and accepts
  `$VAR`), required `project_slug`, and optional `assignee` (a Linear user ID or `me`,
  defaulting to `LINEAR_ASSIGNEE`).
  The legacy flat `tracker.endpoint`, `api_key`, `project_slug`, and `assignee` aliases remain
  supported. `required_labels`, `active_states`, and `terminal_states` stay under `tracker`.
- Scope and paging: candidate reads filter the configured project slug and requested state names,
  following Linear pages of 50. ID refreshes are also project-scoped and batch up to 50 IDs. Empty
  state/ID lists return `{:ok, []}` without a Linear request.
- Identity and normalization: `issue.id` is the Linear issue ID and `issue.native_ref` is currently
  `nil`. Records missing a nonblank ID, identifier, title, or state are dropped from candidate
  pages and fail ID refreshes. State keeps Linear's spelling; integer priorities are preserved and
  other priority values become `nil`; RFC 3339 timestamps are parsed and unusable timestamps become
  `nil`. Labels are trimmed, lowercased, deduplicated, and blanks are dropped; blockers come from
  inverse `blocks` relations.
- Dispatchability: the adapter marks an issue dispatchable only when optional assignee routing
  matches and a `Todo` issue has no non-terminal blocker. The generic scheduler then applies
  active/terminal states, required labels, claims, retries, and concurrency.
- Tool: the Linear adapter advertises `linear_graphql`, accepting either a raw query string or an
  object with nonblank `query` and optional object `variables`. Symphony executes it host-side
  with the session-bound endpoint/token and strips declared token environment variables from the
  Codex child. `project_slug` scopes scheduler reads, not raw tool calls; the tool can access
  whatever the configured Linear token can access.
- Responsibility and errors: `linear_graphql` adds no idempotency key, retry, scope guard, or
  rate-limit policy, so workflows own idempotent mutations and handling provider errors. Read/config
  failures use `{:error, :missing_linear_api_token}`, `{:error, :missing_linear_project_slug}`,
  `{:error, :invalid_linear_endpoint}`, `{:error, :invalid_linear_assignee}`,
  `{:error, :missing_linear_viewer_identity}`, `{:error, {:linear_api_status, status}}`,
  `{:error, {:linear_api_request, reason}}`, `{:error, {:linear_graphql_errors, errors}}`,
  `{:error, :linear_unknown_payload}`, or `{:error, :linear_missing_end_cursor}`. Tool results
  are maps with `"success"`, JSON-string `"output"`, and text `"contentItems"`; invalid
  arguments, missing auth, and transport failures return `"success" => false` with
  `{"error": {"message": ...}}`, while top-level GraphQL errors preserve the response body with
  `"success" => false`.
  For portable reporting, map missing/invalid token, project, endpoint, assignee, or viewer errors
  to `tracker_config` or `tracker_auth`, request failures to `tracker_transport`, non-200 responses to
  `tracker_response` (`429` is `tracker_rate_limited`), GraphQL/unknown payload failures to
  `tracker_payload`, and missing cursors to `tracker_pagination`; logs and tool responses carry the
  human-readable provider detail.

### GitLab adapter profile

- Config: use `tracker.kind: gitlab` with required `tracker.provider.project_path`, optional
  `api_url` (default `https://gitlab.com/api/v4`), and `api_key` (defaults to `GITLAB_PAT` and
  accepts `$VAR`). `project_path` may be a namespaced path such as
  `group/project` or a quoted numeric project ID. Keep explicit `active_states: ["opened"]` and
  `terminal_states: ["closed"]` under `tracker`.
- Scope and paging: candidate reads list issues in the configured project with GitLab offset
  pagination and locally filter requested `opened`/`closed` states. ID refreshes use project-local
  issue IIDs, preserve requested order, omit 404s, and fail malformed requested records. Empty
  state/ID lists return `{:ok, []}` without a GitLab request.
- Identity and normalization: `issue.id` is the project-local IID string, `issue.identifier` is
  route-safe `GL-<iid>`, and `issue.native_ref` retains GitLab's global ID, IID, project ID/path,
  and references map. Description, state, web URL, stable assignee ID, labels, and RFC 3339
  timestamps map onto the generic issue. Labels are trimmed, lowercased, deduplicated, and blanks
  are dropped; priority, branch name, and blockers stay unset because GitLab does not expose a
  matching generic meaning in the issue list.
- Dispatchability: every valid scoped GitLab issue remains provider-dispatchable, including
  confidential and nonstandard issue types visible to the configured token. The generic scheduler
  applies active/terminal states, required labels, claims, retries, and concurrency.
- Tool: the adapter advertises `gitlab_api`, accepting `method`, a relative GitLab REST `path`, an
  optional object `query`, and optional JSON `body`. Symphony forwards the body unchanged,
  executes the request host-side with the session-bound endpoint/token using `PRIVATE-TOKEN`,
  preserves REST status/body in the tool result, and strips `GITLAB_PAT`, `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
  plus any configured `$VAR` token name from the Codex child. Project scope applies to scheduler
  reads, not raw tool calls.
- Responsibility and errors: `gitlab_api` adds no idempotency, retry, or scope policy; workflows
  own provider-specific mutations and error handling. Read/config failures use
  `{:error, :missing_gitlab_api_key}`, `{:error, :missing_gitlab_project_path}`,
  `{:error, :invalid_gitlab_project_path}`, `{:error, :invalid_gitlab_api_url}`,
  `{:error, :invalid_gitlab_issue_id}`, `{:error, {:gitlab_api_status, status}}`,
  `{:error, {:gitlab_api_request, reason}}`, or `{:error, :gitlab_unknown_payload}`. Tool results
  use the same `success`/JSON `output`/text `contentItems` shape as other provider-native tools.

## Web dashboard

The observability UI now runs on a minimal Phoenix stack:

- LiveView for the dashboard at `/`
- JSON API for operational debugging under `/api/v1/*`
- Bandit as the HTTP server
- Phoenix dependency static assets for the LiveView client bootstrap
- Tracker issue identifiers link to the tracker-provided URL when it uses `http` or `https`

## Project Layout

- `lib/`: application code and Mix tasks
- `test/`: ExUnit coverage for runtime behavior
- `WORKFLOW.md`: in-repo workflow contract used by local runs
- `../.codex/`: repository-local Codex skills and setup helpers

## Testing

```bash
make all
```

Run the real external end-to-end test only when you want Symphony to create disposable Linear
resources and launch a real `codex app-server` session:

```bash
cd elixir
export LINEAR_API_KEY=...
make e2e
```

Optional environment variables:

- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` defaults to `SYME2E`
- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` uses those SSH hosts when set, as a comma-separated list

`make e2e` runs two live scenarios:
- one with a local worker
- one with SSH workers

If `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` is unset, the SSH scenario uses `docker compose` to start two
disposable SSH workers on `localhost:<port>`. The live test generates a temporary SSH keypair,
mounts the host `~/.codex/auth.json` into each worker, verifies that Symphony can talk to them
over real SSH, then runs the same orchestration flow against those worker addresses. This keeps
the transport representative without depending on long-lived external machines.

Set `SYMPHONY_LIVE_SSH_WORKER_HOSTS` if you want `make e2e` to target real SSH hosts instead.

The live test creates a temporary Linear project and issue, writes a temporary `WORKFLOW.md`, runs
a real agent turn, verifies the workspace side effect, requires Codex to comment on and close the
Linear issue, then marks the project completed so the run remains visible in Linear.

Run the opt-in GitLab live E2E separately when you want Symphony to create and delete a disposable
issue while exercising a real `codex app-server` session:

```bash
cd elixir
export GITLAB_PAT=...
export SYMPHONY_LIVE_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID=...
SYMPHONY_RUN_GITLAB_LIVE_E2E=1 mix test test/symphony_elixir/gitlab_live_e2e_test.exs
```

The GitLab live test verifies both tracker reads, a workspace file proving the child did not
inherit GitLab token variables, real `gitlab_api` note and close calls, direct API readback, and
issue deletion.

## FAQ

### Why Elixir?

Elixir is built on Erlang/BEAM/OTP, which is great for supervising long-running processes. It has an
active ecosystem of tools and libraries. It also supports hot code reloading without stopping
actively running subagents, which is very useful during development.

### What's the easiest way to set this up for my own codebase?

Launch `codex` in your repo, give it the URL to the Symphony repo, and ask it to set things up for
you.
